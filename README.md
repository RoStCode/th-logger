TH-Logger displays and records temperature and humidity conditions in any space.
The program is easy to use because it uses Windows which is a computing environment that most people recognize themselves in. All functions are easy to learn and use. The program can be configured to restart automatically after a power outage and never needs to be "guarded" or restarted manually.

On the computer screen, you can constantly monitor the current temperature and humidity. With a few mouse clicks you can get easy access to the temperature and moisture conditions measured before. It could be today, the last week, month, or how far back you want to go now. The information is displayed in the form of graphs that give a good overview of what the conditions were. All data is stored automatically without the user having to think about it.
The system currently supports three sensors of three different types.

The system can also be configured with a function to warn when the weather has been such that there is a high risk of attack of mildew.
